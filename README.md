# github-actions-quickstart

### Feedback provided in Feedback-1.png:

This documentation was clear and understandable for me (someone experienced with GitHub). I like that the article points you to sources of prerequisite knowledge (other GitHub documentation). However, if I were a newcomer, I think I would want some more concrete examples of what you might use GitHub Actions for.
